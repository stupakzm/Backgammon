# Backgammon
This repository contains the code for my upcoming Nardi (Backgammon) game.

Project Objective
The primary aim of this project is to offer a versatile Nardi gaming experience that can be enjoyed anytime and anywhere.

Features
Anytime: I'm currently working on optimizing the game for various screen resolutions and preparing a project build.

Anywhere: The game offers three distinct modes:

Trust Mode: This mode is designed for players who trust each other completely. In this mode, all positions are open, and you can use either your own dice or generate them within the game.
Trust Mode Example

Limited Mode: Similar to the Trust Mode, but limited to moves of up to 6 positions forward.
Limited Mode Example

Dice Rules Mode: This mode follows the official rules for dice setting, allowing players to throw their own dice. It's included for those who prefer manual dice rolling over machine-generated ones, although there's also an option for automated dice generation.

Here's how the dice selection works:
Dice Selection Example

Game Rules
When both dice show the same value, you get four moves with those dice.
If a player can't make a move, the game proceeds to the other player's turn.
You can only remove one piece from the starting position.
There's an exception for the first move and rolling double 6's, where you can move two pieces to the sixth position.
"Jumping" over an opponent's sixth position is not allowed.
You cannot close all final positions, which serve as entry points to the home board.

Game Experience
The game takes place within a single scene. After one player wins, you have the option to choose the next game mode to play.

Future Plans
Future enhancements include adding more features such as customizable settings, menus, sound effects, game-saving functionality, and the ability to undo moves, among others.
